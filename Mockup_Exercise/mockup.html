                The program "Development of Web applications with HTML / CSS / JavaScript / jQuerry / AJAX and Bootstrap" 
                is designed for people who have no knowledge or little knowledge of programming on the Web. It starts with presenting
                techniques for designing and developing web pages and applications with HTML / CSS / JavaScript languages. The JavaScript language
                will be presented in detail as it is the basis for more advanced topics that will be presented later such as jQuerry / AJAX / JSON / XML
                and Bootstrap. There will also be Web Servers topics where learners will install and use Apache Tomcat as well as Web Hosting and file transfer
                and management issues using tools such as FileZilla. Also included is the presentation of UI & UX design techniques (User Interface &
                User Experience Design) so that learners are able to understand the visualization techniques of a web page, as well as the presentation of
                GitHub and Git, in order for learners to gradually create a portofolio for their personal or professional development in the labor market.
